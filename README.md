# CVE-2023-25292
Reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS) in Intermesh BV Group-Office version 6.6.145, allows attackers to gain escalated privileges and gain sensitive information via the GO_LANGUAGE cookie

# Vulnerability Details
+ Product: Group Office Application
+ Version: 6.6.145
+ Vulnerability Type: Reflected XSS
+ Severity: Medium
+ CVSS v3.1 Score: 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

# Vulnerability Description
The application is vulnerable to a reflected XSS attack via the “GO_LANGUAGE” cookie that injects 
malicious JavaScript into the application's response. The malicious script is executed in the context of 
the affected website, allowing an attacker to steal sensitive information such as session cookies, 
personal information, etc.
The vulnerability exists in the cookie of the Group Office application. By sending a specially crafted 
cookie to the server, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the response, which is then 
executed in the context of the affected website. This can result in sensitive information being stolen 
from the user's browser, such as session cookies and personal information.

# Impact
This vulnerability allows an attacker to steal sensitive information from the affected website and its 
users, such as session cookies, personal information, and more. An attacker can also use this 
vulnerability to inject further malicious code into the affected website, compromising its functionality 
and potentially exposing sensitive information.

# Remediation for the vendor
+ Filter input data to prevent malicious payloads from being included in the response.
+ Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the execution of untrusted JavaScript in the 
response.
+ Escape or encode all user input before including it in the response.

# Remediation for the end user
+ Upgrade to version 6.6.147 of the Group Office application.


# Steps to Reproduce
1. Go to the vulnerable instance of group-office.
2. Change the “GO_LANGUAGE” cookie with F12, to the following payload: 
```
ar'"()&%<zzz><ScRiPt>alert(911)</ScRiPt>
```
